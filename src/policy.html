          <u>Description Services, Client and Business</u><br /><br />
          Integral Compliance System operates a platform and an application under the name Integral
          Compliance System via the domains [====]. Services are provided via the platform and the
          application.<br /><br />
          The services that are provided via Integral Compliance System are intended for a natural Person
          (the <span class="bold">&quot;Client&quot;</span>) to provide, amend and store Personal Information and other
          information (the
          <span class="bold">“Information”</span>) and make this available to a Person that operates as a service
          provider or business
          (the <span class="bold">“Business”</span>) so that the Business can comply with its identification and
          reporting obligations
          based on the Law towards any Governmental Authority. Information may also be provided directly
          to any Governmental Authority in accordance with the Law.<br /><br />
          A Client under the age of 16 and a representative of a Business under the age of 18 may not use
          Integral Compliance System, because in that case Integral Compliance System cannot comply with
          the specific requirements that apply based on the Law, including as to the use and processing of
          Personal Information. By using Integral Compliance System, the Client declares not to be younger
          than 16 and the representative of a Business declare not to be younger than 18 years.<br /><br />
          The Information provided by the Client is used by a Business that has created an account on
          Integral Compliance System. Integral Compliance System asks each Business to provide certain
          statements truthfully when opening an account and thereafter. Integral Compliance System
          reserves the right to check the statements via public sources and temporarily block or
          permanently delete a Business&#39;s account if the statements appear incorrect. Integral Compliance
          System excludes any liability for any incorrect statements by the Business or the use of the
          Information provided by the Client for any other purpose than intended or permitted.<br /><br />
          The Business will directly use the Information of the Client to comply with its identification,
          reporting and other obligations based on the Law towards any Governmental Authority. Integral
          Compliance System acts as a transport medium for word, writing and image, and provides
          supporting facilities such as document exchange, administration and payment (the &quot;Facilities&quot;).
          Integral Compliance System charges a periodic fee to the Business for opening and maintain an
          account and using the Facilities, not to the Client. The fee charged to the Business is published on
          the Integral Compliance System platform and may be changed from time to time. The fee must be
          prepaid by the Business, is non-refundable and shall not be subject to set-off, reduction or charge
          back, also not in case an account is suspended or terminated prior to the time period for which the
          fee has been paid.<br /><br /><br />
          <h1>Create Account, Suspension and Termination</h1>
          Creating a Client or Business account is done via the &quot;new account&quot; function on the platform. All
          mandatory information or statements must be provided to create an account. Integral Compliance
          System reserves the right to suspend the operation of an account or to terminate it indefinitely at
          its own discretion. Integral Compliance System will, for example, proceed to suspend or terminate
          if incorrect information is provided, in case of abuse or in case of violation of the Law or these
          general terms of use. Any liability for suspension or termination is expressly excluded.<br /><br /><br />
          <h1>Limitation or Exclusion Liability</h1>
          No rights can be derived from Information provided by the Client or use of such Information by the
          Business against Integral Compliance System, and any acts or omissions on this basis will remain entirely
          at the expense and risk of the Client and the Business. This is also a third-party clause for the benefit of
          the Client and the Business against each other.<br /><br />
          Integral Compliance System excludes liability for damage resulting from or in connection with the
          use of Integral Compliance System or the Facilities completely. In addition, Integral Compliance
          System stipulates an exclusion of liability on behalf of the Business and the Client against each
          other insofar as this is legally permissible.<br /><br />
          Under no circumstance shall Integral Compliance System be liable for the compliance by the
          Business or the Client with the Law or any acts or things towards any Governmental Authority, and
          all such liabilities are expressly and completely excluded and waived, as far as required in
          advance, by the Client and the Business.<br /><br />
          All information is further subject to the privacy regulations of Integral Compliance System, stated
          below.<br />
          Integral Compliance System retains the right to block the IP address of a Client or Business for
          future use of the platform, inter alia in the event of suspicion that abuse can be made for the
          preparation or execution of a crime or operations in order to avoid (the risk of) persecution.<br /><br /><br />
          <h1>Privacy Regulations and Personal Information</h1>
          Integral Compliance System respects the privacy of the Client and ensures that Personal
          Information that the Client provides to Integral Compliance System is treated confidentially, except
          as intended by making this available to a Business approved by the Client on the platform or
          application. Given the nature of the platform and application, the Client hereby declares to
          understand and agree that his or her Personal Information will be made available to any Business
          approved by the Client and the Client shall not make any claim with any Governmental Authority in
          connection therewith.<br /><br /><br />
          <h1>Cookies</h1>
          Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on the computer by the browser of the
          Client and the Business. The Integral Compliance System platform uses cookies. Cookies are small
          text files that can be used by websites to make user experiences more efficient. Integral
          Compliance System uses cookies to analyze website traffic, so that the functionality and
          effectiveness of Integral Compliance System can improve. With cookies, the Internet behavior of
          the Client and the Business can be followed on the Integral Compliance System platform or
          application. Integral Compliance System also uses cookies to personalize content and
          advertisements and to provide social media functions. The Client and the Business agree to the
          Integral Compliance System cookies if the platform or application is used.<br /><br /><br />
          <h1>Personal Information, Use and Retention period</h1>
          Integral Compliance System requests Personal Information from the Client only insofar as these
          are necessary to provide a reasonable level of service. Integral Compliance System requires only
          the Personal Information that is required for the purpose for which this Information is requested.
          Personal Information that is not strictly necessary for the level of service for which it is requested
          shall not be requested.<br /><br />
          The IP addresses of the Client and the Business are used to exchange information with the Client&#39;s
          and the Business’ computers.<br /><br />
          The first name, last name, birth date, address, identification documents, supporting documents,
          email address and IP address of the Client are saved if a new account is opened or updated. If the
          Client no longer appreciates this, the Client can indicate this in the preferences profile or by
          sending an email to [contact email ICS]. The Personal Information will then be destroyed. This may
          mean that the Client&#39;s account can no longer be used or must be terminated.<br /><br />
          The Information will be used to enable the Client to use Integral Compliance System, to maintain
          an account and to provide the Information to the Business approved by the Client or any
          Governmental Authority in accordance with the Law. Information that the Client specifically
          granted permission for is also provided to Integral Compliance System. The Information is shared
          with a Business approved by the Client for the purpose of enabling the Business to identify the
          Client and perform legally required reporting to any Governmental Authority in accordance with
          the Law.<br /><br />
          If a new account is created or updated as a Client under Integral Compliance System, the Personal
          Information will be stored on a Secure Server. The Client account stores Information such as first
          name, last name, email address, IP address, granted permissions, approvals or statements.<br /><br />
          If Personal Information is requested by Integral Compliance System and stored in the files for the
          benefit of the service on the platform or application, this data is retained as long as the Client
          account is maintained. If the Client account is terminated, the Personal Information will be
          permanently destroyed within 30 days.<br /><br />
          The Client always has the right to terminate a Client account. This can be done via the profile
          function on the platform or in the application or by sending an email to [contact email ICS]. The
          account is then terminated after the verification that the request originated from the specific Client.<br /><br />
          The Client always has the right to withdraw an authorization or permission to use his Personal
          Information. The Client must send an email to [contact email ICS]. Use of Personal Information is
          then terminated after verification that the request originated from the specific Client. All Personal
          Information of the Client will then be permanently destroyed within 30 days. This may mean that
          use of the Client&#39;s account or a certain communication or service, is no longer possible.<br /><br /><br />
          <h1>Dispute Settlement and Choice of Law</h1>
          Any disputes in connection with these general terms and conditions or the use of Integral Compliance
          System that cannot be settled amicably will only be brought before the competent court in Curaçao.
          This is an exclusive choice of forum. Curaçao Law is exclusively applicable to these general terms and
          conditions and any dispute. This is an exclusive choice of law. The provisions herein do not affect the
          right of the Client to submit a complaint to a Governmental Authority on the basis of any specific
          Curaçao Law.
